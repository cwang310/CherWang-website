          Hello. My name is Cher Wang, and I am a first year student at University of California, Riverside. I am a full-time 
          student and I commute from home. I am in the Pre-Business program, aiming to be a Business Administration Major. I 
          want to concentrate in Accounting because I am good at math. If I am to utilize my ability to do math, I will be able 
          to work hard and do what I like. I commute from Eastvale, which is a convenient 30-40 minute drive. I don't have any 
          experience in job work. I have volunteered every now and then in clubs, but I don't have the time to devote myself to 
          learning, due to school priority. I would like to finish university before finding a job. I don't have job experience 
          but I would like to gain a lot of insight to jobs and what I find the most interesting. I don't think that I would be able 
          to do well unless I learned from class, so I am putting priority to class rather than jobs.
          <br><br>

        I have played piano for ten years. I started playing when I was 5. I am a good team member as I have worked in a duet before. 
        I have done a lot of duets with my brother so I know how to work and coordinate with people well when working together. I do 
        not know if this counts as experience but I have done plenty to of playing piano and how much practice you need to do to play a 
        piece properly. I have good time management. I do my homework on a time limit so I'll be able to balance my work schedule. I do take 
        frequent breaks but it gets me back up running and fully concentrated. I work on short spurts of energy. I am very organized with my 
        work and I don't not slack on the job. I can arrive early and be able to work on high-function if told to. Although I don't have much experience because I am currently 
        in the first-year of university and I didn't take up a job in high school, I am ambitious for a new goal when my schedule frees up.
        <br><br>

        I have volunteered in multiple clubs such as Best Buddies, Circle K, and FBLA. I have done projects such as tutoring kids afterschool, 
        making a presentation, and helping those in need. I have done a 3 day - 2 night volunteer for a Taiwanese church. We went to the poorest 
        city in Taiwan and helped make children's lives better by spreading love to them. Although I was atheist, the fact that the church was 
        just trying to convert them into Christianity, I had a fun time spending time with kids. Knowing that they lived tough lives like, having 
        to live with their grandparents, or having divorced parents, it's a rough time that they go through, not knowing if they are loved and 
        given attention. This was the longest volunteer event that I attended, but it was worthwhile.
